This project aims to integrate two widely used open-source policy modelling frameworks —CLEWS and OG-Core— into a unified, end-to-end decision-support tool for sustainable development planning. By linking sectoral resource systems (climate, land, energy, and water) with a dynamic macroeconomic model, the project will enable policymakers to assess the economy-wide impacts of climate and development policies in a transparent, reproducible, and user-friendly way. These frameworks have been successfully implemented in over 20 countries in a wide range of issues, from informing the development of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement and preventing maladaptation to climate impacts, to assessing options to help lower-income households, or informing on the viability of social protection and pension systems — thus benefitting hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

The Economic Analysis and Policy Division (EAPD) of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) oversees the development and country-level implementation of these open-source modelling tools. For over a decade, these models have supported developing countries facing challenges in achieving sustainable development, particularly Small Island Developing States (SIDS), Land-Locked Countries, and Least Developed Countries. Because they are open source, assumptions are visible and results are reproducible, supporting informed policy discussion. They can be run and adapted at low cost, and they can be calibrated to the data a country actually has, making rigorous analyses feasible in developing and low-income settings where proprietary tools are often out of reach.

The CLEWS (Climate, Land, Energy, Water Systems) framework, built on the [OSeMOSYS - Open Source Energy Modelling System](https://github.com/OSeMOSYS/OSeMOSYS), maps the interactions, synergies, and trade-offs among land use, the energy sector, and water systems under climate change scenarios. It allows users to check the actual, physical viability of their plans, from analyzing whether there will have enough land and water to implement a biofuel policy for energy independence, to studying the impacts of carbon taxes on a green energy transition.

The country-adapted [OG-CORE](https://pslmodels.github.io/OG-Core/content/intro/intro.html) is an overlapping-generations (OG) macroeconomic model that enables dynamic general equilibrium analysis of fiscal, demographic, and economic policies over the long term. OG-Core turns government choices into testable scenarios and shows how they shape growth, jobs, and inequality over time and across generations. It can stress-test a range of major reforms, from taxing and spending choices to health or education policies, and technology shifts such as the effects of AI on productivity.

The OG–CLEWS framework expands both models into a single integrated assessment tool by linking their data structures, execution workflows, and analytical outputs. While both models are mature and widely used, they currently operate as separate tools. This project will create a standardized, automated interface between them and a shared execution and visualization layer, enabling integrated analyses that are not currently possible with existing tools. It will provide policymakers with an easy-to-use, accessible tool to check their plans and strategies and back them with an evidence-based, transparent assessment tool. They will gain a more holistic view of their policies, encompassing natural resources management, the energy sector, and their macroeconomic and fiscal implications, in a novel approach that is not currently available to them.

The enhancements developed through this project will be implemented in more than 10 target countries under an ongoing USD 2 million [Peace and Development Trust Fund](https://www.un.org/en/unpdf) programme, through the through the United Nations [Regular Programme for Technical Cooperation](https://unstats.un.org/capacity-development/activities/rptc.cshtml), as well as through the [Development Account 19th Tranche](https://da.desa.un.org/), ensuring that the results of this work will have real-world impact beyond the GSoC through 2030, helping more countries worldwide achieve their Sustainable Development Goals.

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of the GSoC period, contributors will deliver a platform-independent application that supports the standalone execution of the OG-Core and CLEWS/OSeMOSYS models, as well as the integrated OG–CLEWS model. The work centers on extending https://github.com/OSeMOSYS/MUIO (the existing UI for CLEWS) into a unified tool that manages data and scenarios, orchestrates model runs, and presents outputs from both systems.

1. Cross-platform MUIO: Contributors will refactor and package MUIO so it runs on multiple operating systems beyond Windows, namely MacOS and Linux, preserving all existing functionality. The source code can be found at: https://github.com/OSeMOSYS/MUIO/releases

2. OG-Core module in MUIO: Contributors will implement an OG-Core module within MUIO, extending the user interface so that it provides the same features currently available for CLEWS. This includes data input, creating and managing OG scenarios, configuring run settings, launching runs, capturing logs and run metadata, presenting results through interactive graphs, and organizing outputs in a standardized results structure. The user interface will allow users to select whether to run CLEWS or OG within MUIO.

3. OG–CLEWS coupled module: Contributors will implement a module in MUIO that can execute coupled-model workflows. In coupled mode, MUIO will run one model, apply a provided data exchange pipeline to transform outputs into inputs for the other model, then run the second model. The module will support initially one-way coupling (from CLEWS to OG-Core and vice versa). MUIO will store intermediate exchange files, final outputs and full logs, and will include validation checks that confirm required inputs exist at each step. The user interface will then allow users to select CLEWS only, OG only, or coupled mode. In coupled mode, users will be able to choose linked scenarios, set coupling options (CLEWS to OG or vice versa), run the workflow, monitor progress, and browse outputs for each stage of the coupled execution. The interface will prioritize usability for non-technical users through sensible defaults, guardrails, and informative error messages.

4. OG–CLEWS converging module: Contributors will expand the coupled module into iterative runs, so that users can launch a simulation that will run the models consecutively (run CLEWS, then feed its outputs into OG-Core and run it, then feed its outputs into CLEWS and run it, etc.) until the simulation converges into a solution (i.e., the results remain approximately the same). The user interface will allow users to select CLEWS only, OG only, coupled mode, or converging mode.
